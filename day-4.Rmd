## Getting Started

#### Last Week's Challenges

Last week, I challenged you to find assorted information about the relational data in `nycflights13` and fix a couple untidy data sets. Here are the solutions:

```{r Challenge-Solutions}
# What is the average departure delay for each origin airport?
# What is the average arrival delay for each destination airport?
# Find all the flights that flew over 400 miles. What were their destinations?
# Which airport was the most common destination? (What is its name?)
# Are there any planes in the `flights` table that don't appear in the `planes` table?
# Among the 100 most commonly used planes, what is the most common manufacturer? Most common model?
```

Lengths and albums of Bill Withers songs:
