## Page Under Construction

## Getting Started

Today we will:

* Add colors (colorbrewer)
* Add a theme -> point to documentation
* Learn about visual cues
* Make our R Markdown documents more pretty (chunk options and YAML headers)
* Extension: copy the master examples (a couple graphs for students to copy, then I'll post the code next week and they can see how close they got)

## Adding Colors and Themes

Now that we've learned how to create chart elements with `geom_*()` (where * could be any element), let's add some color to our visualizations. We added elements using the `+` operator, and we can add color and themes using `+` as well!

#### Adding Themes

Themes are a quick way to get a great-looking plot. Download the `ggthemes` package, load it, and just add them on!

```{r Adding_Themes}
library(ggthemes)

ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

[See the documentation](https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/reference/index.html) for a list of available themes.

## Visual Cues

* Strongest/weakest cues
* Why stacked bar charts >>>>>>>> pie charts
